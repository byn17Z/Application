# the whole structure of AST
- [ ] AST is a tree structure that represents the source code of a program. It is generated by the parser and used by the compiler to generate the object code.
- i will divide the structure of AST into 3 parts:
  - []declaration
  - []expression
  - []statement
# Declaration
# Expression
# Statement
# the acess to the AST-> module ast
## this is the structure of AST ,may be changed in the future
对照这个和header文件中的class定义，可以理解AST的结构
