# the whole structure of AST
- [ ] AST is a tree structure that represents the source code of a program. It is generated by the parser and used by the compiler to generate the object code.
- i will divide the structure of AST into 3 parts:
  - []declaration
  - []expression
  - []statement
# Declaration
# Expression
# Statement
# the acess to the AST-> module ast
## this is the structure of AST ,may be changed in the future
对照这个和header文件中的class定义，可以理解AST的结构

CompUnit      ::= FuncDef;
Decl          ::= ConstDecl | VarDecl;
ConstDecl     ::= "const" BType ConstDef {"," ConstDef} ";";
BType         ::= "int";// const int a=3,b=4,c=4;
ConstDef      ::= IDENT "=" ConstInitVal;
ConstInitVal  ::= ConstExp;
VarDecl       ::= BType VarDef {"," VarDef} ";";
VarDef        ::= IDENT | IDENT "=" InitVal;
InitVal       ::= Exp;
FuncDef       ::= FuncType IDEN "(" ")" Block;
FuncType      ::= "int";

Block         ::= "{" {BlockItem} "}";
BlockItem     ::= Decl | Stmt;
Stmt          ::= LVal "=" Exp ";"
| [Exp] ";" // 3+4;
| Block {3+4}
| "if" "(" Exp ")" Stmt ["else" Stmt]
| "while" "(" Exp ")" Stmt
| "break" ";"
| "continue" ";"
| "return" [Exp] ";";
EXP= EXP Value EXP;// 3+4 // 3 4 +
Value= "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" | "==" | "!=" | ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" | "&&" | "||" | "!" | IDEN | Number;
